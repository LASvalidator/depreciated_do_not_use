lasvalidate
===========

An open source implementation of the ASPRS LAS Validation Suite (LVS) to accompany our bid with the ASPRS. We aim at a rapid delivery of the validation tool via a open development process that provides interested parties with transparent opportunities for bug reports, design concerns, and other input at an early stage.

Temporary Restriction: This code is currently being used by rapidlasso GmbH for bidding on the request for proposals (RFP) that was issued by the ASPRS for the implementation of the LAS Validation Suite (LVS). It is not allowed to make use of any parts of this code to submit a competing bid.

The fundamental premise of our bid is to implement the LAS validation tool through an open process that invites early feedback. To make our bid as strong as possible we have completed a partial prototype of the LAS Validation Suite. With this we do not only want to demonstrate our technical capability but also illustrate the way we plan to inject transparency into the development process. More on that here:
